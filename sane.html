          Because BDSM is built around power dynamics, it can often
          tip over into abusive behaviours. These are
          <em><strong>not</strong></em> a part of BDSM, and if you
          think the relationship is becoming abusive, it's best to
          find a way out. Here are some behaviours you should watch
          out for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Pressuring you into acts you're not comfortable
              with.</strong> Whether it be getting into a BDSM
              relationship in the first place, a specific scene, or
              the way in which you live as a couple, consent is a
              vital part of any relationship. If you've made it clear
              you're uncomfortable with doing something, no matter how
              trivial, no responsible Dominant should try to force you
              into it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Expecting your bedroom dynamic to count
              everywhere else.</strong> Unless you've specifically
              agreed to make BDSM a part of your general lifestyle,
              then being your Dominant in sexual situations does not
              give someone the right to control your life in other
              ways.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Acting entitled to your time/attention.</strong>
              This applies to sex, but to other things as well. If
              your Dominant expects to be the highest priority in your
              life, and expects you to drop everything to pay
              attention to them, this is a serious red flag. Again,
              it's possible for this to be part of your arrangement,
              but it has to be something discussed and consented to in
              advance.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Ignoring safewords or making you feel bad for
                using them. </strong>Safewords are a vital part of
                BDSM, and they have to be respected. If your Dominant
                continues regardless after you've used a safeword,
                this is rape. If your Dominant acts as if respecting
                your safeword is an inconvenience to them, or as if
                using your safeword is a sign of weakness, this is
                also extremely unhealthy. Your Dominant's attitudes to
                safewords can be taken as their attitudes to consent.
                If they consider it anything less than vital, you
                should be very wary.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Controlling your relationships with other
              people.</strong> Whether this takes the form of jealousy
              around your friends, or of telling you not to discuss
              the relationship, your partner should not have control
              over your other relationships. Obviously, they are
              allowed to have concerns, but if those concerns take the
              form of controlling behaviour, then that is a major
              danger sign. At the end of the day, your relationships
              are your business.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Ignoring hard or soft limits.</strong> Both hard
              and soft limits <em>can</em> change over time, but that
              change always has to come from the person whose limits
              they are. Don't accept “just this once”. Don't accept
              “we'll build up to it”. Somebody who doesn't respect
              your limits is somebody who doesn't respect your
              consent, and nobody wants to be in arelationship like that.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Not providing emotional support.</strong> BDSM
              can be very emotionally and psychologically draining. A
              good partner will understand this, and provide comfort
              and support when it's needed, including after scenes.
              You should never be made to feel bad for being
              emotional, or for needing comfort.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Using punishment inconsistently, or out of
              scene.</strong> Punishment is, for a lot of people, part
              of BDSM. But punishments should always be something
              which reflects the submissive's behaviour, not the
              Dominant's mood. If your Dominant punishes the same
              behaviour one day and not the next, that is a warning
              sign.  If your Dominant <em>ever</em> punishes you
              without being in scene (that is, without you having
              specifically agreed that you are in a BDSM dynamic at
              the time), that is abuse.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Putting you in risky situations.</strong> Of
              course, there's an element of risk in any BDSM. But it
              can be minimised (see our “Safe BDSM Practice” tab for
              more on how to do this), and if your Dominant is putting
              you in any situation which is likely to cause you
              serious physical or emotional damage, this is
              unaccaptable. Similarly, if you express a concern about
              safety, your Dominant should take it seriously and take
              the time to put your mind at rest. A partner who puts
              your health and wellbeing at risk is not a partner you
              should trust.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Telling you something is okay “because I'm a
              Dominant”.</strong> While, yes, some Dominant behaviours
              are things that would be considered abuse without
              context, those behaviours still require consent.
              Indeed, it is <em>your consent, not their Dominance</em>
              that stops them being abuse. If your Dominant is doing
              something to you, and you tell them you're not
              comfortable with it, they should stop – no matter the
              situation, no matter the action.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Telling you that you have to trust
              them.</strong> Trust is earned. It is entirely normal
              and okay not to trust somebody entirely, and while they
              may be hurt to know that you don't trust them, they
              should also understand. If somebody is making you feel
              guilty for not trusting them... well, honestly, that's
              the best sign there is that you were right not to.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Using guilt as a weapon.</strong> You should
              never be intentionally made to feel guilty by your
              partner. Whether this takes the form of making it all
              about them, bringing up an unrelated slight, or telling
              you that you're “doing kink wrong”, this is abusive
              behaviour. If you spend a lot of time in the
              relationship feeling guilty or ashamed, it may be time
              to consider that the problem is with them, not you.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you see any of these behaviours in your relationship, or
          if you feel threatened or abused by your partner in any way,
          the best thing to do is to discuss it with your partner, or
          to get out of the relationship. <strong><em>Never let anyone
          make you feel like a bad person for leaving a
          relationship.</em></strong> You have the right to be happy
          and healthy, in your love life as much as any other aspect,
          and you have no responsibility to stay in a relationship
          which makes you miserable. Even if you don't think your
          partner is being intentionally abusive, a relationship can
          still be toxic, and you should be absolutely free to leave
          it if you feel like that's what's best for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          This list of danger signs is skewed towards the assumption
          that the reader is a submissive, but it's important to know
          that Dominants can also be abused by their partners, and
          have just as much right to leave a relationship which is
          causing them harm. If you are a Dominant and you are
          uncomfortable with something in your relationship, your
          submissive should take this just as seriously as if it is
          the other way around.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you don't feel that it's safe to talk to your partner
          about your concerns, or to leave the relationship, then help
          is available. You can find information on this in our
          “Useful Resources” tab, or by looking into local shelters
          and help groups. <strong><em>Don't be afraid to tell the
          authorities</em></strong>.  While it may be embarrassing to
          talk about being in a BDSM relationship, the truth is that
          it isn't that unusual. Don't be afraid of being judged, or
          of shocking the authorities. It's better to have a short,
          potentially awkward conversation than to spend any longer in
          a toxic relationship.  This applies no matter what your
          relationship to your partner was, if you had one, before
          kink became a part of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whatever your role or level of kink, you deserve a happy,
          healthy relationship with someone who respects and cares for
          you.

        <h3>Who are you?</h3>
        <p>
          This project is a community effort, and as such involves
          submissions, materials and work from all over the kink
          community (and is being constantly updated), so there is no
          one creator or owner of this site.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, special mention must be made of a few people.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept and design is from Ruth, who also processes
          submissions and PR.
          <br />
          Darael did the coding for the site, and put in far more work
          than any of us in the first few days of the project.
          <em>I think that might be an exaggeration, but whatever
            -Darael</em>
          <br />
          Jormy wrote the majority of the original content, and the
          draft copy for the poster.

        <h3>Why 50 Shades Safer?</h3>
        <p>
          50 Shades Safer exists because many people in the kink
          community have been expressing concerns over unhealthy or
          dangerous trends of people taking their BDSM cues directly
          from 50 Shades of Grey. While it’s great that people are
          gaining an interest in kink, most newcomers to kink lack the
          experience to identify behaviours that, while they may make
          for sexy fantasies and appear to be reasonable, are actually
          very dangerous or poor practise (like jumping straight into
          a 24/7 Master/slave dynamic from a point of no experience,
          or using cable ties or silk ties for bondage). This isn’t to
          condemn 50 Shades of Grey, only to say that it can be
          difficult to access accurate and grounded information on
          safe kink if you don’t know where to look. And so 50 Shades
          Safer was born, as a way to make kink information and advice
          more accessible to newcomers.

        <h3>How can I get in touch?</h3>
        <p>
          If you’ve got questions, comments, advice, submissions, or
          you just want to chat, you can email us at
          50shadessafer@gmail.com and we’ll see what we can do to help
          you out. You can also post general stuff related to the
          project to the #50shadessafer tag on <a
          href="//tumblr.com/tagged/50-shades-safer">Tumblr</a> or <a
          href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/50shadessafer?f=realtime&src=hash">Twitter</a>. We
          don’t currently have a fetlife account, but if anyone wants
          to set one up that would be awesome.
        </p>

        <h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
        <p>
          50 Shades Safer is very much a community project, and we
          welcome submissions, resources and advice from experienced
          kinksters. Unfortunately, we can’t guarantee that your ideas
          will show up on the site, and for space reasons we can’t
          credit everyone who helps us out, but we really want to make
          this as much of a communally-led thing as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’d like to help us spread awareness, you have our blanket
          approval to pass this website on to anyone who might find it
          helpful. In the wake of the opening of the 50 Shades of Grey movie,
          we’re also running a poster campaign to promote the values of safe
          kink - if you’d like to join in, a printable version of the poster can
          be downloaded <a
href="http://www.filedropper.com/poster_2">here</a>. All we ask is
          that you try and refrain from doing anything illegal with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there’s anything practical you think you could help improve
          on, please let us know - the team who built this website did
          it under some time pressure, and if you think you can help us
          make it better, we’d love your help.  If you want to help in
          this way, you can either contact us in the ways mentioned
          above, or if you've got a bit of technical knowhow the entire
          site's code is on <a
        href="//github.com/Darael/fiftyshadessafer">GitHub</a>, where
          we would love to receive pull requests.

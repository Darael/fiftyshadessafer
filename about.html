        <h3>First things first:</h3>
        <p>
          We are <em>literally always</em> happy to accept
          improvements to this site.  It's not exactly the greatest
          work of educational writing ever produced, now is it?  If
          you've got concrete suggestions (and we do need them to be
          concrete, sorry) then you have two options.  You can
          contact one of us via the methods below, or (if you've got
          a bit of technical knowhow) you can make improvements
          directly to the code (which is <a
                                            href="//github.com/Darael/fiftyshadessafer"> on GitHub</a>) and submit a
          "pull request", which is probably going to be much faster.
        </p>
        <h3>Now, who are we, and why did we make this site?</h3>
        <p>
          The original concept and the design mockups came from Red
          OI RED PUT IN WHATEVER NAME/DESCRIPTION TH'ART HAPPY
          WITH.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the actual coding (well, at the time of writing,
          <em>all</em> of the actual coding) was done by Darael, who
          is a computing student and a friend of the above-mentioned
          instigator of the whole thing.  He wasn't going to sleep
          anyway and it seemed like a Thing Worth Doing (tm).
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time the film is released and this page is seen by
          more than like three people, there will probably be other
          contributors.  They are named below.
        </p>
        <h3>How can we reach you?</h3>
        <p>
          Well, you have a couple of options.  Red and Darael are
          both on Tumblr, as thedreadvampy and darael respectively.
          Darael's also reachable by email, with the same username
          at the domain tpchq.org.  There may be other ways.  There
          may not.  Deal with it.

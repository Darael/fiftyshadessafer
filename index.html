          The global phenomenon that is 50 Shades of Grey has got
          people trying out kink and BDSM in amazing numbers, and we
          think that’s great! Experimenting with new things and
          exploring your sexuality is fantastic, and the more people
          have their options opened up, the better! But BDSM can be
          both daunting and dangerous, and while 50 Shades has made a
          good start in introducing the concepts, it’s important to
          remember that it’s a fantasy, and it doesn’t cover all the
          bases when it comes to starting out in BDSM safely.
        </p>
        <p>
          50 Shades Safer is a community project set up to help
          newcomers to BDSM bridge the gap between fantasy and
          reality. Whether you want to fling yourself no-holds-barred
          into the kink scene, or just try out a bit of bondage in the
          bedroom, we’re here to help you do it in a way that’s safe,
          fun and good for you!
        </p>
        <p>
          For the basic facts on safety in BDSM, we’ve set up some
          brief rundowns, broken down to match the three parts of one
          of the major mantras of the kink community: "Safe, Sane, and
          Consensual".  <a href="/safe.html">Safe BDSM Practice</a>
          will take you through some need-to-knows to avoid injury
          while you play, <a href="/sane.html">Danger Signs</a>
          explains how to tell the difference between a healthy, safe
          BDSM relationship and an abusive one, and <a
          href="/consensual.html">Consent</a> explains how to make
          sure everyone’s involved is ok with what’s happening
          throughout. We’re going to add a glossary soon, to help you
          through kink-specific jargon and deal with some
          misconceptions, and there’s already a Resources page so you
          can do some serious research later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you try some of this out and decide it’s not for
          you, or get hooked, make sure you do your research, take
          care of yourself and your partner, and <strong>have
          fun</strong>! We’re rooting for you!

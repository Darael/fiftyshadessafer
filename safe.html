          BDSM done properly can be fun, exciting and safe. But like
          anything else, there are risks, and kink gone wrong can lead
          to injury, trauma or even (very occasionally) put your life
          in danger, so it’s important to be risk-aware and do
          everything you can to make sure your kinky fun stays fun.
        </p>
        <h3>Safewords</h3>
        <h4>Make sure you can tap out when you need to</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is <strong>vital</strong> before doing anything you or your
            partner consider outside vanilla sex that you agree on a
            <strong>safeword</strong>. When the safeword is said, the
            scene <strong>stops</strong>, and it doesn’t start again
            until whatever’s bothering you has been sorted out.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anyone who will keep going after you use the
              safeword is not somebody you want to be doing this
              with.</strong> Safewords exist to make sure everyone
            involved is safe, uninjured, and enjoying the scene. If
            someone doesn’t respect your safeword, it means they are
            putting their gratification over your wellbeing, and
            that’s not something you need in your life. <strong>All
              healthy BDSM relationships are based on respect and care
              for each other</strong>, even if it doesn’t always look
            like it. Whether it’s a bit of light spanking or a totally
            degrading full-time Master/slave dynamic, it can and
            should exist for the enjoyment of everyone involved, and
            that means looking out for each other and respecting each
            other’s boundaries.
          </li>
          <li>
            The safeword doesn’t need to be anything complicated - in
            fact, the simpler it is, the better, since you need to be
            able to say it when you’re potentially in distress or
            pain. <strong>Short, simple words are best.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>“STOP!”</strong> is a perfectly good safeword in a
            lot of occasions. Sometimes, though, you might want to do
            something that involves saying ‘stop’ when you don’t want
            to stop; a lot of the fun of BDSM can be in playing out
            trying and failing to fight someone off or resist
            them. But it’s still important to be able to safeword out
            if you need to (actually, more important, since it’s
            harder for the Dom to tell the difference between play and
            actual distress), so pick a word which won’t come up in
            the scene but that you can easily remember. A lot of
            kinksters use <strong>“RED!”,</strong> for example.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes, you might not be able to say the safeword - if
            you’re gagged or short of air, for example - so it’s also
            really important to have a <strong>gesture or
            signal</strong> which means the same thing, for example
            three sharp taps. Just like the safeword, if you see that
            signal you should stop immediately and check in with your
            partner. Make sure whatever you’re doing, you always have
            a means of clearly indicating your distress.
          </li>
          <li>
            You should feel free to change your safewords/signals by
            mutual agreement at any time that you aren't in-scene.
            You also don't need to have signals that are <strong>definitely
            irrelevant</strong> to the scene you're playing, in
            principle, but it's always better to have them than not.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is a very good idea to make sure that <strong>everyone
            involved</strong> is willing to use the safe-signal.  The
            situation most of us think of is one where the
            submissive/bottom/etc partner safewords out, but
            situations can arise where it is the Dominant participant
            who is uncomfortable with the way a scene is going and
            needs to call an immediate halt the way a safeword implies
            rather than trying to direct the scene away more slowly.
            Usually this is because they suspect that their partner is
            in a headspace where they won’t use the safe-signal even
            if they should, or because they’re experiencing the wrong
            sort of emotional investment in the scene and it feels
            dangerous, but there are other good reasons too.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Physical safety</h3>
        <h4>Because nothing kills the mood like a trip to the
          hospital.</h4>
        <p>Most of this section is geared towards bondage situations,
          so if those don't apply to you you can skip to the last three
        bullet points.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be aware of the equipment you’re using. A very common
          mistake is using narrow ropes, rough synthetics or cable
          ties for bondage. Using <strong>rough or narrow
          ropes</strong> can cause <strong>nerve damage, serious
          abrasions</strong> and <strong>cut off circulation,</strong>
          none of which are much fun (and it’s pretty embarrassing to
          explain to a doctor).
          </li>
          <li>
            Cable ties especially should <strong>never</strong> be
            used for bondage, since they can’t be easily undone and
            can tighten accidentally, cutting off blood supply and
            causing tissue and nerve damage.
          </li>
          <li>
          Be very careful when using ties that could slip or move (like silk or satin). It's harder to verify that these are going to stay safe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Always</strong> make sure you can get out
            immediately. If using rope or fabric ties, keep scissors
            on hand in case the knots tighten too much to quickly
            release. Getting out of too-tight ties quickly can mean
            the difference between minor discomfort and permanent
            damage, and your health is worth more than a bit of rope.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Always</strong> check your ties before you start
            anything bondage-y. Can you undo the knots if necessary?
            Are any of the ropes or ties too tight? <strong>All your
              bonds should be loose enough that you can fit a finger
              between the rope and the skin.</strong> It’s often
            tempting to tie it tighter, but as you tense and put
            pressure on your body, your muscles will tighten and
            something that seemed plenty loose when you started could
            well start cutting off circulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Safeword out</strong> if you feel tingling, pins
            and needles or numbness in anything that’s tied up, if
            there’s noticeable discolouration, or if the position
            you’re in becomes markedly uncomfortable. There’s no shame
            in taking a break to loosen ties or adjust your position,
            and once you’ve got it sorted you can go straight back to
            what you’re doing, if you want! Just make sure you stop,
            let your partner know what’s happening, and fix the
            problem first.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mind your joints.</strong> During bondage, you’ll
            often end up straining against the ropes. This can really
            mess with your joints, especially your knees and
            elbows. Avoid ties or positions that hyperextend or
            compress joints, and try to keep the pressure off. Test by
            flexing and stretching before you start. Again, <strong>safeword
              out</strong> if it feels like you’ve strained something.
          </li>
          <li>
          For the same reason, it's really important not to tie someone up so their weight is held by their arms. Tying someone standing up with their arms above their head, or suspended by their arms, can cause dislocations or constriction.
          <li>
            <strong>NEVER</strong> tie someone up in a way which puts
            pressure on their throat. Don’t put rope around the front
            of the throat, and if you’ve gone for a collar or similar,
            it should <strong>never</strong> be attached to a fixed
            object or to the rest of the ropes. Suspending someone in
            a way that puts their weight on their neck can
            <strong>kill.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>NEVER</strong> leave someone tied up on their
            own. There should always be someone on hand to help out if
            something goes wrong.
          </li>
          <li>
            There’s nothing wrong with a bit of breathplay (choking or
            similar) but here more than ever it is vital that you can
            <strong>stop instantly</strong> if required. Breathplay is
            one of the more dangerous forms of BDSM (a category
            sometimes called "edgeplay"), and if you’re into it it’s
            <strong>vitally important</strong> that you know the signs
            that mean you need to stop. Do plenty of research before
            you try any breathplay, and always remember, if they’re
            <strong>coughing and choking,</strong> if their face is
            <strong>discoloured</strong>, if their <strong>pulse is
              rapid and shallow,</strong> or if they start
            <strong>gasping,</strong> then <strong>STOP IMMEDIATELY
              AND DO NOT GO BACK TO IT</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep your toys clean</strong>! The last thing you
            want is an infection! This applies to sex toys like
            vibrators, dildoes and buttplugs, but equally to anything
            that might break the skin or go in your mouth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Be smart and do your research!</strong> As long as
            you’re respectful with your partner, make sure you both
            know what you’re doing, and make sure you’re aware of the
            risks and how to avoid them, it’s pretty simple! If you
            feel like this is for you, it might be worth taking a
            first aid course so you know you’ll always be prepared!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Psychological health and aftercare</h3>
        <h4>Avoiding trauma is as important as avoiding injury!</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Always, always, always make sure everyone knows
            what they’ re getting into.</strong> What can be fun for
            some people can be horrifying for others, so before you
            try something out, make sure you’ve researched it and know
            exactly what it entails.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Discuss everything you want to do with your
            partner BEFOREHAND.</strong> This means having an actual,
            free conversation, in which you discuss what about it
            works for each of you and what, if anything, to avoid.  It
            notably does <strong>not</strong> mean plonking a contract
            down in front of someone.  That's not how you
            conversation, whatever a certain bestselling book series
            might have to say.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>If someone doesn’t explicitly say they want
              something, then <em>don’t do it</em></strong>. It can be
            tempting to surprise someone with something unexpected and
            exciting, but it’s only ok to do that if you’ve already
            discussed whether or not they’d like it - both the act and
            the being surprised. If you aren’t sure, just
            <strong>ask.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Talk about it after you’re done.</strong> When you
            wrap up a scene, not only is it good for your health to
            talk about it, it means next time you can have an even
            better time! Talk about what was fun, what wasn’t, what it
            made you think you might like… in fact, this is a good
            idea for non-kinky (or "vanilla") sex, too!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AFTERCARE!</strong> BDSM scenes can be pretty
            intense, especially for the submissive, so the Dom should
            always check in with the sub - make sure they’re ok, see
            if they need to talk about anything, if they need to cry,
            if they need a cup of tea and a hug. This is also the time
            to make sure any injuries or grazes are properly looked
            after.
          </li>
          <li>
            It’s often nice to do something relaxing and comfortable
            after a BDSM scene - curling up on the sofa, watching a
            movie together, sticking on some crap TV and having a
            glass of wine, it’s all good. Kink and BDSM is all about
            excitement and tension, and it’s a good idea to wind down
            from that and take some time to recover.

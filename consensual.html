          Consent is always a tricky issue, and becomes even trickier where
          kink is involved. But the most important thing to remember is that
          you should <em>never</em> do anything that you aren't comfortable
          with. Whether you're a submissive or a Dominant, it's vital to make
          sure that both you and your partner are happy and consenting.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Here are some important questions to ask yourself:
        </h3>

        <h4>Do I want this?</h4>
        <p>
          Obviously the most important question in consent, this is
          also the simplest. Do you want to do this thing – not
          because the other person wants to, not because you think you
          ought to want to, but because <em>you</em> want to? If not,
          then you need to stop, let the other person know you're not
          comfortable, and either do something else or end entirely.
          <em>If your partner will not stop a scene when you tell them
          to, this is rape</em>.  Even if they say they couldn't help
          themselves, or that you consented at the beginning of the
          scene, it is still rape.
        </p>

        <h4>Does the other person want this?</h4>
        <p>
          This can be harder to be certain of. Ask your partner
          whether they're okay – not just before a scene, but
          preferably throughout it as well. Make sure that they don't
          feel pressured, and that they're in a fit state to consent
          (i.e., not drunk, not under the influence, etc).  Whether
          they're a Dominant or a submissive, you have a
          responsibility to your partner to make sure they're not
          doing something they don't want to. If they sound uncertain
          or apathetic about their consent, it's best to double-check
          – if you're not completely sure they want it, don't do
          it. You can always find something else to do which doesn't
          overstep their boundaries, even if it's vanilla sex or just
          cuddling and watching TV.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Does everyone involved understand what's being offered?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Before you start a scene, it's important to be absolutely
          sure that everyone involved knows what that scene will
          involve, the risks that might be included, and what their
          role in it will be. It's fun to be spontaneous and exciting,
          but it's also hazardous, so if something new gets introduced
          to a scene, it's important to make sure your partner
          understands your intentions and is okay with them.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Am I being pressured into consent?
        </h4>
        <p>
          This can be a hard question to ask yourself, but it's
          important. Is your partner making you feel as if you
          <em>have</em> to do something, making either implicit or
          explicit threats? Do you feel as if you have to agree to
          something in order to be a “good” submissive or Dominant? If
          you feel like not giving consent will lead to negative
          consequences (e.g., your lover will leave or be disappointed
          in you, you will have failed at kink, you will disappoint
          them, etc.), it is important to take a step back from the
          situation and reassess. <strong><em>If your partner
          threatens you with punishment for witholding consent, this
          is a MAJOR red flag for abuse</em></strong>. Any loving
          Dominant will accept it if you say that you don't want to do
          something, and will give you the space and time to figure
          out what's right for you.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Do I know how to revoke my consent?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Because of the nature of BDSM, it's quite normal to realise
          halfway through a scene (particularly one involving pain or
          sensation play) that you aren't as comfortable with it as
          you thought you would be. If this happens, it's important
          that you can let your partner know, and that they will
          stop. There are some scenes where just saying “no” or “stop”
          can be misconstrued, especially if you're roleplaying, so
          make sure that you have a safeword that you and your partner
          can remember under stress, and that you're not afraid to use
          it. If you plan on doing scenes involving oral sex or
          gagging, it's also a good idea to agree on a hand signal
          beforehand, so you can still safeword even when you can't
          speak.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you answer all these questions with “yes”, then that's
          great! But if you're unsure about any of them, then it's a
          good idea to stop, take a step back, and discuss your
          concerns with your partner. Being unsure about a scene is
          <strong><em>always </em></strong>valid – you should never be
          made to feel ashamed or insecure about saying there's
          something you don't want to do, or asking for more
          information. <strong><em>It is not part of BDSM to ignore
          somebody's concerns about consent.</em></strong> If someone
          tells you that your relationship with them relies on you
          consenting to an act you're uncomfortable with, then that
          relationship isn't worth it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kink is fun, sexy, and exciting. Rape is none of those
          things. And if someone is forcing you into something sexual
          that you're not comfortable doing, that is rape.

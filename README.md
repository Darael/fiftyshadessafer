A site on safe kink (and avoiding the terribly-executed BDSM in a certain best-selling series)

Historically, we've had problems with quote-marks.  Specifically, if
you copy-paste code from a number of places (including, for example,
Google Docs or OpenOffice documents) you're liable to get "smart"
quotes, viz: ‚Äù.  These are fine in a lot of contexts, but will break
links.  Links need to use real quotemarks (" or '), so be sure to redo
them after pasting them into a file.  The easy way is to do a
search-and-replace.

We're still missing some content.  Help would be much appreciated!

The TODO list, which shouldn't be *too* out of date

- Mobile stylesheet
- more resources are always useful

A site on safe kink (and avoiding the terribly-executed BDSM in a certain best-selling series)

We're missing a *lot* of content.  Help would be much appreciated!

The TODO list, which shouldn't be *too* out of date

- Mobile stylesheet
- Title/introduction in safe.html
- edits to about.html
- non-lipsum content in sane.html
- non-lipsum content in consensual.html
- non-lipsum content in resources.html

So y'know.  Only a little bit OH GODS WE'RE DOOMED

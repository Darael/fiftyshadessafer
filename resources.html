        <h3>A note before we begin</h3>
        <p>
          We, the site authors, are based in the UK, so here even more
          than the rest of the site you'll find a tendency to
          UK-specific information.  That said, don't skip it if you
          aren't based here, because there's a fair proportion of
          region-agnostic resources too.  Just, well, look before you
          leap.

        <h3>BDSM links and community</h3>
        <p>
          Nothing’s better for research than lived experience! It can
          be a bit daunting going into kink spaces, and if you don’t
          want to, nobody will judge you, but most kinksters are
          friendly and welcoming - if you aren’t ready for a fetish
          event where people will be doing BDSM things, a lot of local
          communities hold ‘munches’, where you can go and meet other
          kinksters in a casual environment.  Here are some places to
          get info on these things.

        <h3>Where to buy sex toys and other equipment</h3>
        <p>
          Buying good toys to bring into your play is really
          important, both for your enjoyment and for your
          safety. Cheap toys can be made of unsafe or carcinogenic(!)
          materials or be poorly made so they promote infection. This
          is one area where it really is worth forking out a bit more!

            When we first put this up, we called it "A fun comic
            that’s also a fantastic introduction to sex toy safety,
            care and recommendations".  There have been some
            high-profile... <em>problems</em>... since then, but
            overall they're still pretty good.  OJST's advice on
            what's necessary for safety ("don't do this thing", "make
            sure you do that") is usually solid, but occasionally in
            the other direction there's a recommendation that isn't
            safe.  Take with a pinch of salt, as with <em>most</em>
            sources of advice on these matters.

          specific areas of safety in BDSM.

        <h3>Getting and Giving Consent</h3>
        <p>
          There’s nothing more important in healthy BDSM than
          consent, so make sure you know the ins and outs of what
          is and isn’t adequate consent.

        <p>
          We’ve given you a quick run down on abuse in BDSM, but
          it’s worth reading up on signs of abuse both in and
          out of the kink scene
